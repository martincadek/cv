Doctoral Researcher, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, 2017 – 2021
Conducted research to improve routine feedback letters with height and weight results delivered to parents of Reception and Year 6 children as part of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in England.
Engaged multiple stakeholders such as Local Government, Public Health England, and parents, providing nuanced insights into the NCMP. Developed three complex studies using qualitative and quantitative methods.
Gathered opinions of 92 Local Government Authorities in England, providing results to Public Health England for further improvement. Prepared cluster randomised controlled trial and analysed complex survey data using various regression models.
Developed and improved feedback letters, resulting in better parental perceptions. Utilised computerised text analysis techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modelling (LDA), and hierarchical clustering. Used Google Natural Language Processing speech-to-text API for automatic transcription of interviews.
Published research as part of my PhD, including contributions to articles such as "The Psychological Science Accelerator's COVID-19 Rapid-Response Dataset," "Effect of health-care professionals' weight status on patient satisfaction and recalled advice," and other studies focusing on public health, health messaging, and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
