     "Summer School of Causal inference with observational data: the challenges and pitfalls (5 days course). This five-day summer school offered state-of-the-art training in the analysis of observational data for causal inference. By exploring the philosophy and utility of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) participants learn to recognise and avoid a range of common pitfalls in the analysis of complex causal relationships, including the longitudinal analyses of change, mediation, nonlinearity and statistical interaction",

     "Exploratory Multivariate Data Analysis (MOOC) by FranÃ§ois Husson, Professor of statistics. The course focused on four essential and basic methods: principal component analysis (PCA) to handle quantitative variables, correspondence analysis (CA) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to handle categorical variables and clustering, and an extension to Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to analyse a more complex dataset that is structured by groups",
     
     "Course", "Leeds Beckett University", "Leeds, England", "2017",
     "Understanding statistics and data analysis in R. This five-day course led by Professor Clive Beggs aimed to equip students and staff with the understanding necessary to undertake post-graduate research. The course covered topics such as variance & probability, parametric hypothesis testing, non-parametric testing, generalized linear models, bootstrapping & Monte Carlo techniques, and introduction to machine learning.",
     
     "Course", "University of Cambridge", "Cambridge, England", "2016", 
     "Certified IRT and CAT course using Concerto at Psychometric Centre (3 days course). This course focused on producing online state-of-the-art psychometric tests, as well as an introduction to the Item Response Theory (IRT), Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), and the open-source online adaptive test development platform, Concerto"
